# Hey there! 👋 I'm Ananya Pandey

Welcome to my GitHub 👩‍💻  
I'm an Android developer who loves building useful, clean, and smart apps — the kind people actually enjoy using. Whether it’s streaming video from a drone or simplifying contacts on your phone, I like to build things that *work well and look good doing it.*

## 🚀 Projects I’ve Built (and loved)

### 🎯 [Sansmriti Application]
A smart assistant for project selection using AI. It also auto-generates reports, manages company registrations, and has a chatbot to guide users.

### 📱 [Contact-Ease]
An all-in-one contact app to manage calls, logs, and contacts with a sleek interface. Smooth navigation, real-time calls — simple and handy.

### 🛸 [SKY-CAST] 
Streams RTSP video from drone/IP cams. You can record, PiP the video, or just chill and watch your drone fly — all from your phone. (Yes, it's as cool as it sounds.)
